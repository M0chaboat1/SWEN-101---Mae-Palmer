Some things about me include my love for fighting games (specifically guilty gear strive), music (creating, learning, understanding, etc), and just my love for positivity and joy ^-^
I went to 2 highschools, Del Campo HS and El Sereno HS. I lived in Sacramento Califorina before moving to Rochester; and I have multiple pets at home!
